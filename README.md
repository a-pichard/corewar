# Introduction
corewar is an EPITECH year end project writen in C. Corewar is a game. A very special game. It consists of pitting little programs against one another in a virtual machine.
The goal of the game is to prevent the other programs from functioning correctly by using all available means.
The game will, therefore, create a virtual machine in which the programs (written by the players) will face off. Each
program’s objective is to "survive", that is to say executing a special instruction ("live") that means I’m still alive.
These programs simultaneously execute in the virtual machine and in the same memory zone, which enables them
to write on one another.
The winner of the game is the last one to have executed the "live" instruction
